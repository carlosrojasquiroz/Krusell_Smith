# Solving Aiyagari model with aggregate shocks by Krusell-Smith algorithm

This folder contains some functions and scripts in MATLAB to solve the Aiyagari model with 
aggregate shocks.

Open the file "master.m" to run all the files. 

The current configuration disallows to show figures or display the progress of the code in the 
Command Window. If you want to change it, go to "parameters.m" and change the corresponding
values.
